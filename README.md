# Xmonad-Dotfiles
Here are all of my XMonad dotfiles available for reference and cloning.

You will need to get the command line visualizer from this link:
https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer

Setup dependencies:
htop (or top)
cli-visualizer (linked above)
neofetch/screenfetch/pfetch (you are going to have to refer to the first two if you choose them)
picom/compton
xterm (my personal choice)
xmonad-contrib (you need the contrib for certain imports)
i3-lock (not NEEDED but a basic screen-lock utility)
